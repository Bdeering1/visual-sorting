# Visual Sorting App
  
A visual demonstration of a few common sorting algorithms developed with React and Redux. 
  
### Features
  
- state managed by Redux and passed to React components as needed  
    - uses composed reducers for better separation of concerns between different aspects of state
    - uses redux-thunk middleware to allow for dispatch of asynchronous actions  
- demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction   
- fully responsive and cross browser compatible
